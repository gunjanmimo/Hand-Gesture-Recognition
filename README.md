# Hand Gesture Recognition using Keras Nural Network and Keras Subclassing API

Model subclassing is fully-customizable and enables you to implement your own custom forward-pass of the model.

Sequential model does not allow you much flexibility to create your models. Functional API also only has a little of customization available for you. But you may create your own fully-customizable models in Keras. This is done by subclassing the Model class and implementing a call method.
